📊 Student Feedback Analysis Using Python & NLP
A Data Analysis & Sentiment Interpretation Project

📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback collected from a college event using Python.
The dataset includes both numerical ratings and textual comments, making it ideal for performing:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Rating distribution analysis
Sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Identification of event strengths and improvement areas
Visualization and interpretation of overall student perception
The final output helps institutions make data-driven decisions to improve future events.

🎯 Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw student feedback data
Analyze numerical ratings to find highest and lowest scoring parameters
Perform sentiment analysis on textual comments
Visualize trends in student responses
Identify key strengths and improvement areas
Generate insights for institutional decision-making
Prepare a comprehensive analysis report

❗ Problem Statement
Colleges frequently collect student feedback after events, but the information often remains unused because:
Raw comments are difficult to interpret manually
Numerical ratings alone do not reveal detailed sentiment
There is no automated way to identify positive or negative patterns
Institutions struggle to understand what genuinely worked and what didn’t
This project solves the problem by applying Python-based analysis and NLP techniques to convert raw data into actionable insights.

📦 Dataset Description
File Name: student_feedback.csv
